This Repository is constructed as a screeening to the course designed by Code Vector AI labs.

The screening consists of four tasks as described below:

2) Execution of "text_extraction.py" generates "output.txt","output1.csv"

output.txt : Text file containing text extracted from one PDF profile.
output1.csv : CSV file containing the data of all 50 profiles under "LinkedIn Profiles" label.
